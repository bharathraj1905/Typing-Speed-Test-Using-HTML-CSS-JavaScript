##  How It Works

- When the user clicks **Start Test**, a 3-second countdown begins
- A quote appears based on the selected difficulty
- Typing input is compared **character-by-character** with the quote
- The app updates:
  - Time elapsed
  - Words Per Minute (WPM)
  - Accuracy
- On completion, it shows:
  - Final WPM and Accuracy
  - Highest score stored in local browser using `localStorage`
